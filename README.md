# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 

## Overview

This project employs supervised machine learning techniques (specifically regression analysis) to predict the hourly demand for bike rentals in Seoul. The goal is to optimize bike availability, reduce wait times, and enhance urban mobility by ensuring bikes are available when and where they are needed.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of detailed hourly records from Seoul's bike-sharing system and includes environmental and operational variables:

- **Temporal Data**: Specific hour of the day for bike rentals.
- **Weather Conditions**: Includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dew point temperature, solar radiation, rainfall, and snowfall.
- **Operational Status**: Indicates whether the bike-sharing system was operational at a specific time.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- The initial data processing includes cleaning and focusing on essential variables that significantly affect bike rentals.
- The analysis specifically targets the peak demand time at noon to capture essential usage patterns.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Utilizes statistical analysis and visualizations to explore relationships between environmental factors and the number of bikes rented.
- Identifies key predictors and their effects on bike demand.

### Model Development
- Implements a linear regression model to predict the number of required bikes based on multiple influencing factors.
- The model provides insights into demand trends and helps in decision-making for bike fleet management.

## Results

- The regression model effectively predicts bike rental demand, emphasizing the impact of various weather conditions.
- The predictive insights assist in managing the bike fleet by aligning supply with anticipated demand changes due to weather conditions and operational status.
